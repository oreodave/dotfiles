;;; Commentary:

;; This provides colourising for ada files.  Is not compatible with
;; standard ada-mode due to name conflicts.  Personally I'd rather
;; have a mode for colourising a buffer which is what this is supposed
;; to be.

;; I feel ada-modeâ„¢ (the official one) tries to do too many things at
;; once, so I want something that does the basics.  Also want to take
;; this opportunity to make a new mode and see what facilities Emacs
;; provides for it.

;; TODO: Handle indenting
