#+startup: noindent

#+begin_center
My configuration for (a very specific form of) Emacs
#+end_center
#+latex: \clearpage
#+toc: headlines

* Basics
Firstly, set full name and mail address.  This is used in encryption
and mailing.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Aryadev Chavali"
      user-mail-address "aryadev@aryadevchavali.com")
#+end_src

Let's set all yes or no questions to single letter responses.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+end_src

Set the encoding to UTF-8-Unix by default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emacs
  :straight nil
  :init
  (setq-default buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8-unix
                save-buffer-coding-system 'utf-8-unix))
#+end_src

Setup no-littering, which cleans up many of the default directories in
Emacs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package no-littering
  :demand t
  :init
  (setq no-littering-etc-directory (expand-file-name ".config/"  user-emacs-directory)
        no-littering-var-directory (expand-file-name ".local/" user-emacs-directory)))
#+end_src
** File saves and custom file
Setup automatic saving for files (in case of system failure) and
auto-revert-mode (which refreshes the buffer on changes to the
underlying file).  Along with that, set the custom-file (which holds
temporary customisation)  in the etc folder.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emacs
  :straight nil
  :init
  (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(no-littering-expand-var-file-name "saves/")))
        global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t
        auto-revert-verbose nil)
  (setq custom-file (no-littering-expand-etc-file-name "custom.el"))
  :config
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1))
#+end_src
* Custom functionality
Functions that don't require a packages to work other than Emacs,
which means I can define them early.  These are used much later in the
config.
** Toggle buffer
Like VSCode's toggling feature for just the terminal but now for
any buffer of choice, as long as I can generate it via a command.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load "window"
  (defmacro +oreo/create-toggle-function (func-name buf-name
                                                    buf-create
                                                    &optional accept-numeric)
    "Generate a function named FUNC-NAME that toggles the buffer with
name BUF-NAME, using BUF-CREATE to generate it if buffer BUF-NAME
does not exist already.

BUF-NAME cannot be a regexp, it must be a fixed name.

ACCEPT-NUMERIC modifies the function to allow numeric arguments
via C-u.  Mostly used in Eshell."
    (let ((interactive-arg
           (if accept-numeric '(interactive "p") '(interactive)))
          (arguments
           (if accept-numeric '(&optional arg) nil))
          (buffer-name (if accept-numeric
                           `(if (= arg 1)
                                ,buf-name
                              (concat ,buf-name "<" (int-to-string arg) ">"))
                         buf-name))
          (buffer-create (if accept-numeric
                             `(if (= arg 1)
                                  (,buf-create)
                                (,buf-create arg))
                           `(,buf-create))))
      `(defun ,func-name ,arguments
         ,interactive-arg
         (let* ((buffer (or (get-buffer ,buffer-name)
                            ,buffer-create))
                (displayed (get-buffer-window buffer)))
           (if displayed
               (delete-window displayed)
             (display-buffer buffer)
             (select-window (get-buffer-window buffer))))))))
#+end_src
** Auto-run command after-save-hook
Define a macro, which creates hooks into the ~after-save-hook~.  On
certain ~conditions~ being met, ~to-run~ is evaluated.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package simple
  :straight nil
  :config
  (defmacro +oreo/create-auto-save (conditions &rest to-run)
    "Create a hook for after saves, where (on CONDITIONS being met)
TO-RUN is evaluated. "
    `(add-hook 'after-save-hook #'(lambda ()
                                    (interactive)
                                    (when ,conditions
                                      ,@to-run)))))
#+end_src
** Procedure
A ~lambda~ which takes no arguments is a procedure.  This macro
generates procedures, with the parameters of the macro being the body
of the procedure.  It returns it in quoted form, as that is the most
common use of this macro.

(You may notice ~proc~ is used where the return value doesn't matter).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro proc (&rest BODY)
  "For a given list of forms BODY, return a quoted 0 argument
lambda."
  `(quote (lambda nil ,@BODY)))
#+end_src
** System specificity
A macro that acts as a switch case on ~(system-name)~ which allows the
writing of system specific code.  For me this is for my desktop and
laptop, particularly for font sizes.  Though there may be an easier
solution than this, this seems simple enough.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro +oreo/sys-name-cond (&rest pairs)
  "Switch case on result of function `system-name'.

Each pair in PAIRS is typed as: (string . (forms...)) where the
string represents the system name to test, and forms being the
consequence if true."
  `(cond
    ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (pair)
      ;; (str . forms..) -> ((string= str (system-name))
      ;; forms...)
      (let ((name (car pair))
      (body (cdr pair)))
        `((string= ,name (system-name)) ,@body)))
  pairs)))
#+end_src

In [[file:early-init.el][early-init.el]] I set the number of native-workers to 4, which isn't
necessarily optimal when loading/compiling the rest of this file
depending on the machine I use:
- On my laptop (=spiderboy=) I'd prefer to have it use 2-3 threads so I
  can actually use the rest of the laptop while waiting for
  compilation
- On my desktop (=oldboy=) I'd prefer to use 4-6 threads as I can
  afford more, so I can get a faster load up.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(+oreo/sys-name-cond
 ("spiderboy"
  (setq native-comp-async-jobs-number 3))
 ("oldboy"
  (setq native-comp-async-jobs-number 6)))
#+end_src
** Clean buffer list
Instead of cleaning my buffer list manually, selectively preserving
some fixed set of buffers, this function does it for me.  Preserves
any buffers in ~+oreo/keep-buffer~ and kills the rest.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst +oreo/keep-buffers
  (list "config.org" "*scratch*"
        "*dashboard*" "*Messages*"
        "*Warnings*")
  "List of buffer names to preserve.")

(defun +oreo/clean-buffer-list ()
  "Kill all buffers except any with names in +oreo/keep-buffers."
  (interactive)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (buf)
              (if (not (member (buffer-name buf) +oreo/keep-buffers))
                  (kill-buffer buf)))
          (buffer-list)))
#+end_src
* Aesthetics
General look and feel of Emacs (mostly disabling stuff I don't like).
** Themes
*** Dark theme
My preferred dark theme is my own "personal-primary" theme which is
stored in the Emacs lisp folder (look at [[file:elisp/personal-primary-theme.el][this file]]).  It tries to use
the primary colours for everything, leading to a colour -> meaning
relation.

I have an older version of this theme that uses a homogeneous colour
scheme ([[file:elisp/personal-theme.el][this file]])
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package custom
  :demand t
  :straight nil
  :init
  (setq custom-theme-directory (concat user-emacs-directory "elisp/"))
  :config
  (load-theme 'personal-primary t))
#+end_src
*** Light theme
I'm not very good at designing light themes as I don't really use
them.  However they are necessary in high light situations where a
dark mode would strain the eyes too much.  So I built a custom theme
on top of the default Emacs theme, "personal-light" (look at [[file:elisp/personal-light-theme.el][this
file]]).

I don't use it by default but I may need to switch between light and
dark easily, so here's a command to switch between them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package custom
  :defer t
  :straight nil
  :commands +oreo/switch-theme
  :init
  (defvar +oreo/theme 'dark)
  :config
  (defun +oreo/switch-theme ()
    (interactive)
    (cond
     ((eq +oreo/theme 'dark)
      (load-theme 'personal-light t)
      (setq +oreo/theme 'light))
     ((eq +oreo/theme 'light)
      (load-theme 'personal-primary t)
      (setq +oreo/theme 'dark)))))

#+end_src
** Font size
Set font size to 140 if on my desktop (oldboy) or 175 if on my laptop
(spiderboy).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package faces
  :straight nil
  :config
  (+oreo/sys-name-cond
   ("spiderboy" (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 175))
   ("oldboy" (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 140))))
#+end_src
** Startup screen
The default startup screen is quite bad in all honesty, great for
first time users who have no idea what is going on but terrible for
regular users.

The scratch buffer is an interaction buffer made when Emacs is first
started, as a way to quickly prototype Emacs Lisp code.  When startup
screen is disabled, this buffer is the first thing presented on boot
for Emacs.  So we can use it to store some useful information.

As I use [[*Org mode][org-mode]] to compile my Emacs, it is available
essentially at startup, so I use it for the scratch buffer.  That way,
I can use all the abilities of org-mode (particularly writing a system
of code using =#+RESULTS=) in an ephemeral buffer at startup!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emacs
  :straight nil
  :init
  (setq
   inhibit-startup-screen t
   initial-major-mode 'org-mode
   initial-scratch-message (format "#+title: Scratch buffer
,#+author: %s
,#+description: Emacs v%s

Booted in %s!
" user-full-name emacs-version (emacs-init-time))
   ring-bell-function 'ignore))
#+end_src
** Blinking cursor
Turn off blinking-cursor-mode as [[*Hl-line][hl-line]] is better.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package frame
  :straight nil
  :config
  (blink-cursor-mode 0))
#+end_src
** Fringes
Turning off borders in my window manager was a good idea, so turn off
the borders for Emacs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package fringe
  :after dashboard
  :straight nil
  :config
  (fringe-mode 0))
#+end_src
** Mode line
A mode line in an editor can provide a LOT of information, or very
little.  I customised the Emacs modeline to give me a bit of info,
~telephone-line~ to give me a lot.

Currently I use the default mode line with some customisation;
simplicity is above all.
*** Emacs Mode-line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +mode-line/generate-padding ()
  (let ((wid (frame-width))
        (str ""))
    (dotimes (n (floor (/ wid 7)))
      (setq str (concat str " ")))
    str))

(setq-default

                             evil-state

#+end_src
*** WIP Telephone-line

:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no

extensibility.  It also looks much nicer than the default mode line

* Core packages
Packages that are absolutely necessary for the rest of the
configuration.  These yield core functionality such as keybinding,
modal editing, completion, auto typing to name a few.
** General
General provides a great solution for binding keys.  It has evil and
use-package support so it fits nicely into configuration.  In this
case, I define a "definer" for the "LEADER" keys.  Leader is bound to
~SPC~ and it's functionally equivalent to the doom/spacemacs leader.
Local leader is bound to ~SPC ,~ and it's similar to doom/spacemacs
leader but doesn't try to fully assimilate the local-leader map,
instead just picking stuff I think is useful.  This forces me to learn
only as many bindings as I find necessary; no more, no less.

I also define prefix leaders for differing applications.  These are
quite self explanatory by their name and provide a nice way to
visualise all bindings under a specific heading just by searching the
code.

** Evil
My editor journey started off with Vim rather than Emacs, so my brain
has imprinted on its style.  Thankfully Emacs is super extensible so
there exists a package (more of a supreme system) for porting Vim's
modal editing style to Emacs, called Evil (Emacs Vi Layer).

However there are a lot of packages in Vim that provide greater
functionality, for example 'vim-surround'.  Emacs, by default, has
these capabilities but there are further packages which integrate them
into Evil.
*** Evil core
Setup the evil package, with some opinionated keybindings:
- Switch ~evil-upcase~ and ~evil-downcase~ because I use ~evil-upcase~

** Completion
Emacs is a text based interface.  Completion is its bread and butter
in providing good user experience.  By default Emacs provides
'completions-list' which produces a buffer of options which can be
searched and selected.  We can take this further though!

Ido and Icomplete are packages distributed with Emacs to provide
greater completion interfaces.  They utilise the minibuffer to create
a more interactive experience, allowing incremental searches and
option selection.

Ivy and Helm provide more modern interfaces, though Helm is quite
heavy.  Ivy, on the other hand, provides an interface similar to Ido
with less clutter and better customisation options.
*** Ivy
Ivy is a completion framework for Emacs, and my preferred one.  It has
a great set of features with little to no pain with setting up.
**** Ivy Core

Ido is a very old completion package that still works great to this

*** Amx
Amx is a fork of Smex that works to enhance the

** Pretty symbols
Prettify symbols mode allows for users to declare 'symbols' that
replace text within certain modes.  Though this may seem like useless
eye candy, it has aided my comprehension and speed of recognition
(recognising symbols is easier than words).

Essentially a use-package keyword which makes declaring pretty symbols
for language modes incredibly easy.  Checkout my [[C/C++][C/C++]] configuration
for an example.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package prog-mode
  :straight nil

#+end_src

Here's a collection of keywords and possible associated symbols for
any prog language of choice.  Mostly for reference and copying.

** Window management
Emacs' default window management is quite bad, eating other windows on
a whim and not particularly caring for the current window setup.
Thankfully you can change this via the ~display-buffer-alist~ which
matches buffer names with how the window for the buffer should be
displayed.  I add a use-package keyword to make ~display-buffer-alist~
records within use-package.

I have no idea whether it's optimal AT ALL, but it works for me.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

        args)))))
#+end_src
*** Some display records
Using the ~:display~ keyword, setup up some ~display-buffer-alist~
records.  This is mostly for packages that aren't really configured
(like [[info:woman][woman]]) or packages that were configured before
(like [[Ivy][Ivy]]).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Auto typing
Snippets are a pretty nice way of automatically inserting code.  Emacs
provides a ton of packages by default to do this, but there are great
packages to install as well.

Abbrevs and skeletons make up a popular solution within Emacs default.
Abbrevs are for simple expressions wherein the only input is the key,
and the output is some Elisp function.  They provide a lot of inbuilt
functionality and are quite useful.  Skeletons, on the other hand, are
for higher level insertions

The popular external solution is Yasnippet.  Yasnippet is a great
package for snippets, which I use heavily in programming and org-mode.
I setup here the global mode for yasnippet and a collection of
snippets for ease of use.
*** Abbrevs
Just define a few abbrevs for various date-time operations.  Also
define a macro that will assume a function for the expansion, helping
with abstracting a few things away.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

                        (proc (insert ,(cadr abbrev)))))

#+end_src
*** Auto insert
Allows inserting text immediately upon creating a new buffer with a
given name.  Supports skeletons for inserting text.  To make it easier
for later systems to define their own auto inserts, I define a

entry for ~auto-insert-alist~.

this ~esup~ thing and it works perfectly, exactly how I would prefer
getting this kind of information.  It runs an external Emacs instance

** Projectile
Projectile is a project management package which integrates with Emacs
very well.  It essentially provides alternative Emacs commands scoped
to the current 'project', based on differing signs that a directory is
a 'project'.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package projectile

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package counsel-projectile
  :after (projectile counsel)
  :config
  (counsel-projectile-mode +1))
#+end_src
** Avy
Setup avy with leader.  As I use ~avy-goto-char-timer~ a lot, use the
~C-s~ bind which replaces isearch.  Switch isearch to M-s in case I
need to use it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Ace window
Though evil provides a great many features in terms of window

Which key uses the minibuffer when performing a keybind to provide
possible options for the next key.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Keychord
Keychord is only really here for this one chord I wish to define: "jk"

#+end_src
** (Rip)grep
Grep is a great piece of software, a necessary tool in any Linux
user's inventory.  By default Emacs has a family of functions to use
grep, presenting results in a ~compilation~ style.  ~grep~ searches
files, ~rgrep~ searches in a directory using the ~find~ program and
~zgrep~ searches archives.  This is a great solution for a general
computer environment; essentially all Linux installs will have ~grep~
and ~find~ installed.

Ripgrep is a Rust program that attempts to perform better than grep,
and it actually does.  This is because of a set of optimisations, such
as checking the =.gitignore= to exclude certain files from being
searched.  The ripgrep package provides utilities to ripgrep projects
and files for strings.  Though [[*Ivy][ivy]] comes with ~counsel-rg~, it uses
Ivy's completion framework rather than the ~compilation~ style
buffers, which sometimes proves very useful.

Of course, this requires installing the rg binary which is available
in most repositories nowadays.
*** Grep
I have no use for standard 'grep'; ~counsel-swiper~ does the same
thing faster and within Emacs lisp.  ~rgrep~ is useful though.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Olivetti
Olivetti provides a focus mode for Emacs, which makes it look a bit
nicer with fringes.  I also define ~+olivetti-mode~ which will
remember and clear up any window configurations on the frame, then
when turned off will reinsert them - provides a nice way to quickly
focus on a buffer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

at last.

* Applications
Applications are greater than packages; they provide a set of

applications and others may be installed.

** Mail
Mail is a funny thing; most people use it just for business or
advertising and it's come out of use in terms of personal
communication in the west for the most part (largely due to "social"

free software movement who heavily use mail for communication.

Integrating mail into Emacs helps as I can send source code and
integrate it into my workflow just a bit better.

** Xwidget
Xwidget is a package which allows for the insertion of arbitrary
xwidgets into Emacs through buffers.  It must be compiled into Emacs
so you might need to customise your install.  One of its premier uses
is in navigating the web which it provides through the function
~xwidget-webkit-browse-url~.  This renders a fully functional web
browser within Emacs.

Though I am not to keen on using Emacs to browse the web /via/ xwidget
(EWW does a good job on its own), I am very interested in its
capability to render pages with JavaScript, as it may come of use when
doing web development.  I can see the results of work very quickly
without switching windows all within Emacs.

Also define a function ~+xwidget/search-query~ that first asks the
user what search engine they want to use ([[https://duckduckgo.com][Duck Duck Go]] and [[https://devdocs.io][DevDocs]]
currently) then asks for a query, which it parses then presents in an
xwidget window.  Bind to ~as~ in the leader.

** Eshell
*** Why Eshell?
Eshell is an integrated shell environment for Emacs, written in Emacs
Lisp.  I argue that it is the best shell/command interpreter to use in
Emacs.

Eshell is unlike the alternatives in Emacs as it's a /shell/ first,
not a terminal emulator. It has the ability to spoof some aspects of a
terminal emulator (through the shell parser), but it is NOT a terminal
emulator.

The killer benefits of eshell (which would appeal to Emacs users) are
a direct result of eshell being written in Emacs lisp:
- incredible integration with Emacs utilities (such as ~dired~,
  ~find-file~, any read functions, to name a few)
- very extensible, easy to write new commands which leverage Emacs
  commands as well as external utilities
- agnostic of platform: "eshell/cd" will call the underlying change
  directory function for you, so commands will (usually) mean the same
  thing regardless of platform
  - this means as long as Emacs runs, you can run eshell

However, my favourite feature of eshell is the set of evaluators that
run on command input.  Some of the benefits listed above come as a
result of this powerful feature. These evaluators are described below.

Lisp evaluator: works on braced expressions, evaluating them as Lisp
expressions (e.g. ~(message "Hello, World!\n")~).  Any returned
objects are printed.  This makes eshell a LISP REPL!

External evaluator: works within curly braces, evaluating them via
some external shell process (like sh) (e.g. ~{echo "Hello,
world!\n"}~).  This makes eshell a (kinda dumb) terminal emulator!

The alias evaluator is the top level evaluator.  It is the main
evaluator for each expression given to eshell.  When given an
expression it tries to evaluate it by testing against these conditions:
- it's an alias defined by the user or in the ~eshell/~ namespace of
  functions (simplest evaluator)
- it's some form of lisp expression (lisp evaluator)
- it's an external command (bash evaluator)
Essentially, you get the best of both Emacs and external shell
programs *ALL WITHIN* Emacs for free.
*** Eshell functionality

*** Eshell variables and aliases
Set some sane defaults, a banner and a prompt.  The prompt checks for
a git repo in the current directory and provides some extra
information in that case (in particular, branch name and if there any
changes that haven't been committed).

Also add ~eshell/goto~, which is actually a command accessible from
within eshell (this is because ~eshell/*~ creates an accessible
function within eshell with name ~*~).  ~eshell/goto~ makes it easier
to change directories by using Emacs' find-file interface (which is
much faster than ~cd ..; ls -l~).

~eshell/goto~ is a better ~cd~ for eshell.  However it is really just

** Magit
Magit is *the* git porcelain for Emacs, which perfectly encapsulates
the git cli.  In this case I just need to setup the bindings for it.
As magit will definitely load after evil (as it must be run by a
binding, and evil will load after init), I can use evil-collection
freely.  Also, define an auto insert for commit messages so that I
don't need to write everything myself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Processes
Emacs has two systems for process management:
+ proced: a general 'top' like interface which allows general
  management of linux processes
+ list-processes: a specific Emacs based system that lists processes
  spawned by Emacs (similar to a top for Emacs specifically)

*** Proced
Core proced config, just a few bindings and evil collection setup.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package proced
  :straight nil

    "p" #'proced)

Along with that I setup the package ~proced-narrow~ which allows
further filtering of the process list.

** Calculator
Surprise, surprise Emacs comes with a calculator.

Greater surprise, this thing is over powered.  It can perform the
following (and more):
- Matrix calculations
- Generalised calculus operations
- Equation solvers for n-degree multi-variable polynomials
- Embedded mode (check below)!

~calc-mode~ is a calculator system within Emacs that provides a
diverse array of mathematical operations.  It uses reverse polish
notation to do calculations (though there is a standard infix
algebraic notation mode).

Embedded mode allows computation with the current buffer as the echo
area.  This basically means I can compute stuff within a buffer
without invoking calc directly: $1 + 2\rightarrow_{\text{calc-embed}} 3$.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package calc
  :straight nil
  :display
  ("*Calculator*"
   (display-buffer-at-bottom)

#+end_src
*** WIP Calctex
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
~calc-mode~ also has a 3rd party package called ~calctex~. It renders
mathematical expressions within calc as if they were rendered in TeX.
You can also copy the expressions in their TeX forms, which is pretty
useful when writing a paper.  I've set a very specific lock on this
repository as it's got quite a messy work-tree and this commit seems to
work for me given the various TeX utilities installed via Arch.

Man pages are the user manuals for most software on Linux.  Really
useful when writing code for Un*x systems, though they can be very
verbose.

2023-08-17: `Man-notify-method' is the reason the `:display' record

* Text modes
Standard packages and configurations for text-mode and its derived
modes.
** Flyspell
Flyspell allows me to quickly spell check text documents.  I use
flyspell primarily in org mode, as that is my preferred prose writing
software, but I also need it in commit messages and so on.  So
flyspell-mode should be hooked to text-mode.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Undo tree
Undo tree sits on top of the incredible Emacs undo capabilities.
Provides a nice visual for edits and a great way to produce branches
of edits.  Also allows saving of undo trees, which makes Emacs a quasi
version control system in and of itself!  The only extra necessary
would be describing changes...
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Whitespace
Deleting whitespace, highlighting when going beyond the 80th character
limit, all good stuff.  I don't want to highlight whitespace for

* Programming packages
Packages that help with programming in general, providing IDE like
capabilities.
** Eldoc
Eldoc presents documentation to the user upon placing ones cursor upon
any symbol.  This is very useful when programming as it:
- presents the arguments of functions while writing calls for them
- presents typing and documentation of variables

Eldoc box makes the help buffer a hovering box instead of printing it
in the minibuffer.  A lot cleaner.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eldoc
  :straight nil
  :hook (prog-mode-hook . eldoc-mode)
  :init
  (global-eldoc-mode 1))

(use-package eldoc-box
  :hook (eldoc-mode-hook . eldoc-box-hover-mode)

        eldoc-box-clear-with-C-g t))
#+end_src
** Eglot
Eglot is package to communicate with LSP servers for better
programming capabilities.  Interactions with a server provide results
to the client, done through JSON.

NOTE: Emacs 28.1 comes with better JSON parsing, which makes Eglot
much faster.

2023-03-26: I've found Eglot to be useful sometimes, but many of the
projects I work on don't require a heavy server setup to efficiently
edit and check for errors; Emacs provides a lot of functionality.  So
by default I've disabled it, using =M-x eglot= to startup the LSP
server when I need it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eglot
  :after project

#+end_src
** Flycheck
Flycheck is the checking system for Emacs.  I don't necessarily like
having all my code checked all the time, so I haven't added a hook to
prog-mode as it would be better for me to decide when I want checking
and when I don't.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

However, if necessary later, define a function that may activate tabs locally.

** Highlight todo items
TODO items are highlighted in org-mode, but not necessarily in every
mode.  This minor mode highlights all TODO like items via a list of
strings to match.  It also configures faces to use when highlighting.
I hook it to prog-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

          ("WIP"   . "#ffa500")

** Hide-show mode

** Aggressive indenting
Essentially my dream editing experience: when I type stuff in, try and
indent it for me on the fly.  Just checkout the

* Org mode
2023-03-30: finally decided to give org mode its own section.

Org is, at its most basic, a markup language.  Files use the ".org"
extension and use =org-mode= to write text, with the ability to export
to a few formats, all within Emacs.  Some other features include:
+ A complete spreadsheet system, with formulas (including
  [[*Calculator][calc-mode]] integration)
+ Evaluation of code blocks, even using the results of them in exports
  (to, say, a $\LaTeX$ or HTML document)
  + This includes exporting code blocks to a code file.  All the
    emacs-lisp code blocks in this file are compiled to =config.el=
    ([[file:elisp/literate.el][literate]])
+ Complete calendar/todo system with deadlines, scheduling and
  repeaters
+ Export to a variety of formats or make your own export engine using
  the org AST!
  + Writing latex in document, with ability to render them on demand,
    and exporting to PDFs through Latex
** Org Essentials
Org has a ton of settings to tweak, which change your experience quite
a bit.  My setup should be as portable as possible and (/sometimes/) I
need to access org mode files in other editors, so org files should be
as close to clear text as possible.  This is the guiding philosophy
that essentially makes most of my options pretty immediate.

Some arbitrary notes:
+ By default =~/Text= is my directory for text files.  I actually have
  a repository that manages this directory for agenda files and other
  documents
+ Indentation in file should not be allowed, i.e. text indentation,
  as that forces other editors to read it a certain way as well.  It
  seems obtrusive hence it's off.
+ Org startup indented is on by default as most documents do benefit
  from the indentation, but I do turn it off for some files via
  ~#+startup:noindent~
+ When opening an org document there can be a lot of headings, so I
  set folding to just content
+ Org documents can also have a lot of latex previews, which make
  opening some after a while a massive hassle.  If I want to see the
  preview, I'll do it myself, so turn it off.
+ Org manages windowing itself, to some extent, so I set those options
  to be as unobtrusive as possible

** Org Latex
Org mode has deep integration with latex, can export to PDF and even
display latex fragments in the document directly.  I setup the
pdf-process, code listing options via minted and the format options
for latex fragments.

** Org Core Variables
Tons of variables for org-mode, including a ton of latex ones.  Can't
really explain because it sets up quite a lot of local stuff.  Also I
copy pasted the majority of this, tweaking it till it felt good.  Doom

Org message allows for the use of org mode when composing mails,

Toggle latex fragments in org mode so you get fancy maths symbols.  I
use latex a bit in org mode as it is the premier way of getting
mathematical symbols rendered, but org mode > latex.

Delimited environments are aplenty, escaped brackets and dollar signs
are my favourite.  Here's a snippet:
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}$.

#+end_src
* Languages
Configuration for specific languages or file formats.
** PDF
I use PDFs mostly for reading reports or papers.  Though Emacs isn't
my preferred application for viewing PDFs (I highly recommend
[[https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/][Zathura]]), similar to most things with Emacs, having a PDF viewer
builtin can be a very useful asset.

For example if I were editing an org document which I was eventually
compiling into a PDF, my workflow would be much smoother with a PDF
viewer within Emacs that I can open on another pane.
*** PDF tools
~pdf-tools~ provides the necessary functionality for viewing PDFs.
There is no proper PDF viewing without this package.
~evil-collection~ provides a setup for this mode, so use that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package pdf-tools
  :mode ("\\.[pP][dD][fF]\\'" . pdf-view-mode)

#+end_src
*** PDF grep
PDF grep is a Linux tool that allows for searches against the text
inside of PDFs similar to standard grep.  This cannot be performed by
standard grep due to how PDFs are encoded; they are not a clear text
format.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package pdfgrep

** SQL
The default SQL package provides support for connecting to common
database types (sqlite, mysql, etc) for auto completion and query
execution.  I don't use SQL currently but whenever I need it it's
there.

#+end_src
** NHexl
Hexl-mode is the inbuilt package within Emacs to edit hex and binary
format buffers.  There are a few problems with hexl-mode though,
including an annoying prompt on /revert-buffer/.

Thus, nhexl-mode!  It comes with a few other improvements. Check out
the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/nhexl-mode.html][page]] yourself.

** C/C++
Setup for C and C++ modes via the cc-mode package.  C and C++ are
great languages for general purpose programming.  My preferred choice
when I want greater control over memory management.
*** cc-mode
Tons of stuff, namely:

+ Some keybindings to make evil statement movement is easy
+ Lots of pretty symbols
+ Indenting options and a nice (for me) code style for C (though
  aggressive indent screws with this a bit)

** Haskell
Haskell is a static lazy functional programming language (what a
mouthful).  It's quite a beautiful language and really learning it will
change the way you think about programming.  However, my preferred
functional language is still unfortunately Lisp so no extra brownie
points there.

Here I configure the REPL for Haskell via the
~haskell-interactive-mode~.  I also load my custom package
[[file:elisp/haskell-multiedit.el][haskell-multiedit]] which allows a user to create temporary
~haskell-mode~ buffers that, upon completion, will run in the REPL.
Even easier than making your own buffer.
