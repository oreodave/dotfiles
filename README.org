#+DESCRIPTION: README for Dotfiles

* Introduction
My Dotfiles repository with configuration files for most of the
applications I use on a daily basis.
* Install
Clone this into the =~/Dotfiles= directory.  Install Emacs. Win.

** Installing Emacs
I like a specific set of flags on my Emacs install.  Prepackaged
installs just won't cut it.  Hence we're going to clone =emacs-27=
from GNU then compile it.  Just run the following part:

#+begin_src sh
cd .local/src/emacs;
curl -LO http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-27.2.tar.gz
tar -xvf emacs-27.2.tar.gz .
./configure --with-xwidgets -with-threads --with-harfbuzz --with-jpeg --with-json --with-modules;
make;
sudo make install;
#+end_src

** Currently used modules
- XServer
- vim
- Shell
- SystemD
- Emacs
- Mail
- mailcap
- Neovim
- ClangFormat
