** Installing Emacs
I like a specific set of flags on my Emacs install.  Prepackaged
installs just won't cut it.  So I'd highly recommend cloning and
building my personal [[https://git.aryadevchavali.com/emacs][Emacs
repo]] (currently =v28.1=).  Or, if you're lazy, just run the
following:

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/.local/src;
git clone git@git.aryadevchavali.com:/git/emacs.git emacs;
cd emacs;
sh personal-install; # Will configure, build and attempt to install
#+end_src
