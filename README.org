#+TITLE: Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Aryadev Chavali
#+DESCRIPTION: README for Dotfiles

* Introduction
My Dotfiles repository with configuration files for most of the
applications I use on a daily basis.
* Install
Clone this into the =~/Dotfiles= directory.  Install Emacs. Win.

** Installing Emacs
I like a specific set of flags on my Emacs install.  Prepackaged
installs just won't cut it.  Therefore, to make it leverage more of
the system I've created, we're going to use my build of Emacs.

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/.local/src;
git clone git@git.aryadevchavali.com:/git/emacs.git;
cd emacs;
sh personal-install;
#+end_src
** Currently used packages
- XServer
- vim
- Shell
- SystemD
- Emacs
- Mail
- Neovim
- ClangFormat
